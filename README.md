Project: House Prediction Using Linear Regression

Context:

Congratulations! You have been hired on as a junior data analyst to determine house prices. Your first project is to develop a house price prediction model that takes in multiple variables to predict the price of how much a house would be. There are several options at your disposal and it would be great if you could create multiple models and display them for our stakeholders.

Acceptance Criteria:

- Utilize the provided dataset (all_perth_310121.csv) to develop 4 different models using linear regression
	- Primer on linear regression: https://www.ibm.com/topics/linear-regression
	- Check out scikit-learn and Numpy to handle the linear regression

- Output the graph of each model using Matplotlib on a singular chart with labels

- Use Panadas dataframes to parse out the data
